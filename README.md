This repository contains all the Packet Tracer projects and configurations I have worked on to demonstrate my understanding and practical application of networking concepts, with a particular focus on CCNA skills.  

Each small project focuses on a specific concept or combines multiple concepts such as:
- Connecting different network devices (Routers, Switches, PCs)
- Configuring VLANs and Subnetting
- Static & Dynamic Routing
- Basic network security and management configurations

The goal of this repository is to document my hands-on experience in networking and share practical examples that showcase how to design and operate small to medium-sized networks.
